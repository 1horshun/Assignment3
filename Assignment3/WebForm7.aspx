            To start off, we are both students who are in love with fashion. 
			We love trying out different styles and bring the best out of it. 
			We are not fashion icons but we hope to bring in different styles and share what we love to you. 
			We want you to be confident and happy when you put on our products! 
        </p>

            We started this on 8th of March in conjunction with International Women's Day. 
			It is a special day to indicate it is time for us to step out of comfort zone.

            We are both shopping lovers and we understand the happiness when we shop. 
			Hence, we realised why not we take a further step to sell what we love. 
			We are shopping and selling what we love at the same time, so it doubles our happiness!
